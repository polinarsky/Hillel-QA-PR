</head>
<body>
  <h1>Bergen, Norway</h1>
  <p>Bergen is a city on Norway's southwestern coast. It's surrounded by mountains and fjords, including Sognefjord, the country's longest and deepest. Bryggen features colorful wooden houses on the old wharf, once a center of the Hanseatic League's trading empire. The Fløibanen Funicular goes up Fløyen Mountain for panoramic views and hiking trails.</p>
